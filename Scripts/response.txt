I'm happy to help you with your test project.

So, you're asking about "where have i talked about later in this project?" - Well, let me check! As far as I know, we've discussed something about time stamps and how they relate to specific video content. We talked about the start time of 0 seconds in Video #Spongebob and ended at 2 seconds with the text "A few moments later". Then later on in another video (Video #ONE), there's a similar mention of "a few moments later" within the sound effects section.

If you're looking for more information about this topic, I'd recommend checking out Video #Spongebob from around the 0-2 second mark. Would that be helpful?
